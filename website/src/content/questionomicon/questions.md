## Language Questions

* [ ] How do I pass a paramter by value in Golang?
* [ ] How do I pass a paramter by reference in Golang?
* [ ] How do I declare a new type (classes, interfaces) in Golang?
* [ ] How do I work with Enums in Golang?
* [ ] How do I work with Generics in Golang?
* [ ] What about polymorphism in Golang?
* [ ] What about multithreading in Golang?
* [ ] What about deep copy / shallow copy /immutability of objects in Golang?
* [ ] What about asynhronous functions in Golang?
* [ ] What about building a golang package containing only types definitions, and re-use the package into a golang app?
* [ ] The expression `T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T`. A few examples of type conversions can be seen in example4, for primary types. Yet, We will see if the same syntax can be used to convert between complex Types I will define, like Upcasting Downcasting between "siblings" types (eg classes with _"inherits"_ relation) in other languages.
* [ ] What about collection types in Golang (Set, Map Lists, LinkedLists)?
* [ ] see all types of loops in Golang (for while foreach iterators in relation with ?)
* [ ] network programming in golang ? How to send/receive ARP / ICMP /  IP / TCP / UDP ? implement a wake on lan
* [ ] What about multi threading and semaphores in Golang ?
