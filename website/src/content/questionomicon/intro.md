The goals of this work are:

* To learn as much as I can about the golang language, until I can read any golang code "fluently": If I readany code writtent in OGlang, I want to be very quickly able to understandwhat it does, and be able to debug, fix, and improve it.
* To answer all of questions, that I may think of, about the Golang language, and golang development.

_**In the Questionomicon, I everyday write questions I have about the Golang language, and golang development.**_
